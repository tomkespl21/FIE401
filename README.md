# FIE401 Financial Econometrics

This is the repository for the course FIE401 "Financial Econometrics" by Professor Maximilian Rohrer. 

The course is mostly about using econometric techniques to find causal answers to questions related to finance.

For this my solutions to assignments and the final exam can be found here, which contain R programming.
